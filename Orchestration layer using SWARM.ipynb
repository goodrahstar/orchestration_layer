            "\n",
            "2. **Verify the Upgrade:**\n",
            "   - Once the router has restarted, log back into the web interface.\n",
            "   - Check the firmware version under the router's settings to confirm it has been upgraded successfully.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 5: Testing\n",
            "1. **Reconnect Devices:**\n",

            "\n",
            "### Step 1: Diagnose the Problem\n",
            "1. **Test Internet Speed:**\n",
            "   - Use an online speed test tool like Speedtest.net to measure the current internet speed.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Check for Outages:**\n",
            "   - Ensure there are no service outages or maintenance activities from the internet service provider.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Device-Specific Checks:**\n",
            "   - Test the internet speed on multiple devices to determine if the issue is device-specific or affects all devices.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 2: Improve WiFi Signal Strength\n",
            "1. **Router Placement:**\n",
            "   - Ensure the router is positioned centrally in the home, away from obstructions, and elevated for better signal distribution.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Avoid Interference:**\n",
            "   - Keep the router away from devices that may cause interference, such as microwaves or cordless phones.\n",
            "   - Consider changing the WiFi channel in the router settings to reduce interference from neighboring networks.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Check for Other Devices:**\n",
            "   - Limit the number of connected devices if bandwidth is being shared among many devices.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 3: Router and Network Optimization\n",
            "1. **Firmware Update:**\n",
            "   - Ensure the router firmware is up to date, as newer firmware often resolves bugs and improves performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **QoS Settings:**\n",
            "   - Enable Quality of Service (QoS) in the router settings to prioritize bandwidth for critical applications and devices.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Reset Your Router:**\n",
            "   - Restart the router to refresh the connection. If persistent issues occur, perform a factory reset to clear potential configuration errors.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 4: Device Optimization\n",
            "1. **Software Update:**\n",
            "   - Update all connected devices with the latest operating systems and drivers to ensure compatibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Limit Background Applications:**\n",
            "   - Close unnecessary applications and background processes that may be consuming bandwidth.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Check Network Adapter:**\n",
            "   - Ensure the device’s network adapter settings are correct and functioning optimally.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 5: Advanced Troubleshooting\n",
            "1. **Scan for Malware:**\n",
            "   - Run a malware scan to ensure that no malware or virus is affecting network performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Consider a Wired Connection:**\n",
            "   - Use a wired Ethernet connection to devices that require stable and fast internet, such as desktop computers or smart TVs.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Contact Support:**\n",
            "   - If issues persist, contact the internet service provider's support for further diagnostics and assistance.\n",
            "\n",
